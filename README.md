# Object-Detection-and-Tracking
This project implements real-time object detection and tracking using YOLO (You Only Look Once) with OpenCV. The system detects multiple objects in a live video stream or video file and applies tracking algorithms (SORT/Deep SORT) to assign unique IDs to each object. Bounding boxes and labels are drawn around detected objects,
